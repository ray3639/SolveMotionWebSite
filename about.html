<!-- ================= INTRO ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h1>About SolveMotion Labs</h1>
  <p class="lede">
    SolveMotion Labs started as a hands-on effort to help kids, nieces, and nephews
    navigate education and early careers with clearer paths, better information,
    and real confidence.
  </p>
  <p>
    What began as a personal project grew into a broader realization:
    many people struggle not because they lack ability,
    but because guidance is fragmented, unclear, or locked behind systems
    that weren’t built for them.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= WHAT THIS IS ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>What this lab is — and is not</h2>

  <p>
    SolveMotion Labs is a focused product lab.
    It builds practical tools designed to support judgment, learning,
    and decision-making.
  </p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li><strong>This is not</strong> a consulting firm, content farm, or data brokerage</li>
    <li><strong>This is not</strong> an attempt to replace professionals or human expertise</li>
    <li><strong>This is</strong> a place to build tools that explain, organize, and guide</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The goal is usefulness — not scale for its own sake.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= BELIEFS ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>What we believe</h2>

  <ul class="list">
    <li>People do better when guidance is structured and actionable</li>
    <li>Information should be usable, not buried or performative</li>
    <li>Tools should evolve over time, especially as AI improves</li>
    <li>Accessibility matters — clarity is a form of inclusion</li>
    <li>Good systems respect human judgment rather than replace it</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= AI APPROACH ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Our approach to intelligence and AI</h2>
  <p>
    Intelligence is a tool, not a goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where AI is used, it is applied carefully — to summarize,
    identify patterns, and surface trends — never to assert certainty
    where none exists.
  </p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li>No hidden decision-making engines</li>
    <li>No opaque scoring without explanation</li>
    <li>No replacement of professional judgment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Every intelligent feature is designed to make the user
    more informed, not more dependent.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= HOW IT FITS ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>How the pieces fit together</h2>
  <p>
    SolveMotion Labs products share common design principles
    and evolve together:
  </p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li><strong>Applications</strong> focus on specific problems and domains</li>
    <li><strong>The platform</strong> provides shared structure and future capabilities</li>
    <li><strong>The roadmap</strong> emphasizes clarity, restraint, and usefulness</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can explore individual tools on the
    <a href="applications.html">Applications</a> page,
    or learn more about shared direction on the
    <a href="platform.html">Platform</a> page.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= LONG TERM ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Looking forward</h2>
  <p>
    SolveMotion Labs will continue to evolve — slowly, deliberately,
    and in public.
  </p>
  <p>
    New capabilities are added only when they improve clarity,
    understanding, or decision support.
    If something doesn’t make the tool more useful,
    it doesn’t ship.
