<!-- ================= INTRO ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h1>Applications</h1>
  <p class="lede">
    Each application in the SolveMotion Labs suite is built as a focused tool —
    with consistent standards, clear boundaries, and a roadmap toward AI-enhanced guidance.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Shared product philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    While each application serves a different purpose, they all follow the same design principles:
  </p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li><strong>Clarity over complexity</strong> — tools should reduce confusion, not add to it</li>
    <li><strong>Guidance, not automation</strong> — support decisions without replacing judgment</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency by default</strong> — explain what the system can and cannot do</li>
    <li><strong>Incremental intelligence</strong> — improve responsibly as data and models mature</li>
  </ul>

<!-- ================= HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>How these tools work together</h2>
  <p>
    Each application can be used independently,
    but they are designed to align conceptually:
  </p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li>SolveMotion and SolveOura focus on physical readiness and recovery</li>
    <li>SolveIt emphasizes interpretation and scenario awareness</li>
    <li>SolveMind and SolvePharmacy support structured learning and progression</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Over time, shared platform components will allow
    insights, patterns, and guidance concepts to evolve consistently across tools.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= ROADMAP ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Roadmap direction</h2>
  <p>
    The roadmap for SolveMotion Labs focuses on
    responsible intelligence expansion:
  </p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li>Richer explanations and summaries</li>
    <li>Trend-based guidance instead of raw outputs</li>
    <li>Optional AI-enhanced insights with clear disclaimers</li>
    <li>Continued emphasis on user control and understanding</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    No system will claim certainty where none exists —
    the goal is better judgment, not blind automation.

<!-- ================= FAQ ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <div class="faq">

    <h4>Do I need to use all of the applications?</h4>
    <p>
      No. Each application is designed to be useful on its own.
      Some people use one tool exclusively; others combine them
      as their needs grow.
    </p>

    <h4>Is this AI making decisions for me?</h4>
    <p>
      No. The goal is guidance and clarity — not automation.
      Any AI-assisted features are designed to support human judgment,
      not replace it.
    </p>

    <h4>Is my data private?</h4>
    <p>
      These tools are designed with minimal data collection
      and clear intent. There are no hidden monetization models
      or data resale practices.
    </p>

    <h4>Are these tools experimental?</h4>
    <p>
      Some features evolve over time, but the core functionality
      is designed to be practical and stable.
      New capabilities are added carefully and transparently.
    </p>

    <h4>Who are these tools built for?</h4>
    <p>
      They’re built for people who value clarity:
      athletes, students, professionals, and anyone who wants
      structured guidance without hype.
    </p>

    <h4>Will these applications continue to improve?</h4>
    <p>
      Yes — with an emphasis on responsible evolution.
      Improvements focus on better explanations, clearer trends,
      and optional intelligence enhancements over time.
